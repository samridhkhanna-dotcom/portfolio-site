ðŸ“± Viewport Sizes

Mobile (up to 480px): I went with 480px because a lot of smaller smartphones fit under this size. It keeps the layout simple and stacked so everything is easy to read on a phone.

Tablet (481px â€“ 1024px): Tablets usually fall in this range. I adjusted the font sizes and layout here so it doesnâ€™t feel too cramped or too spaced out.

Laptop/Desktop (1025px and up): Anything bigger than a tablet I considered a laptop/desktop. I set this breakpoint so the content looks balanced on larger screens.

ðŸŽ¨ Gradients

I used gradients to add some style to the site instead of leaving flat colors.

On mobile pages, I used a light gray vertical gradient in the background so text pops out.

On tablet, I added a diagonal gradient in the header (blue tones) to make the navigation stand out.

On laptop, I used a horizontal gradient in the footer (white to light gray) to finish the page cleanly.

Hex codes I used include:

#004080 (dark navy)

#ff6600 (orange accent)

#f9f9f9 and #e0e0e0 (light grays)
